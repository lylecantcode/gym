# Gym (Tracker)

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/0Em6o0eiW0I 
#### Description:
An exercise tracker to be used in CLI.
Created using GO, customised to my normal routine.

Complete up to and including v8.

## Project Plan:

~v1) Take unputs of weights, units and date into SQL, display it after an input~  
~v2) Number of sets and multiple exercises per day. //Take input of number of exercises, then weights, sets, etc~  
~v3) Types of exercise done, e.g. Bench Press~  
~v4) Reorganised to use structs~  
~v5) Predictions based on day of week (for 7 day rotating schedule)~  
~v6) Add reps (replace sets with separate values, so can have different weights for each set)~
~v7) Add enums in for exercise and unit options~  
~v8) Personal bests per exercise, as a comparison to new workout~  

## Potential extras:

> Overwrite date option  
> Delete entries
