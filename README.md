Creating an exercise tracker for the gym.

Currently working on V2.

**Project Plan:**

v1) Take unputs of weights, units and date into SQL, display it after an input.  
v2) Number of sets and multiple exercises per day. //Take input of number of exercises, then weights, sets, etc  
v3) Types of exercise done, e.g. Bench Press  
v4) Predictions based on day of week (for 7 day rotating schedule)  
v5) Personal bests per exercise, as a comparison to new workout

**Potential extras:**

> Overwrite date option  
> Delete entries  
> Custom commands to display certain values, e.g. certain exercises, date, bests
